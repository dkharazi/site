const sampleArticle = `European regulators have accused Apple (AAPL) of violating EU antitrust law, saying the company's app store rules unfairly restrict rival music services.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's top antitrust official, said Friday that Apple is in breach of competition law because it charges app developers high commission fees and forbids them from telling users about cheaper alternatives.
