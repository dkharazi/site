### Describing Law of Large Numbers
- The law of large numbers assumes independent, identically-distributed (IID) random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$
- We assume each random variable has a finite population mean $\mu$
- We know that the sample mean $\bar{x}$ is an unbiased estimator for the population mean $\mu$
- In other words, our best guess of the population mean $\mu$ is the sample mean $\bar{x}$
- The law of large numbers states that as the number of observations in our sample grows larger, then our sample mean will converge closer to the population mean

### Weak Law of Large Numbers
- The weak law of large numbers states that the sample mean converges in probability towards the population mean
- Specifically, there is a high probability that the sample mean will be close (within some non-zero margin) to the population mean, assuming a large enough sample size

### Strong Law of Large Numbers
- The strong law of large numbers states that the sample mean converges to the population mean
- Specifically, the sample mean will equal the population mean, assuming a large enough sample size
- If the strong law of large numbers holds true for a set of random variables, then the weak law of large numbers holds true as well
- However, if the weak law of large numbers holds true for a set of random variables, the the strong law of large numbers does not necessarily hold true
- Typically, the strong law of large numbers will not hold true if there isn't independent sampling
