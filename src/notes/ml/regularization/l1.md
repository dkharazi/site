### Describing L1 Regularization
- L1 regularization is regularization technique used for variable selection
- L1 regularization achieves variable selection by shrinking the OLS coefficients down to zero
- L1 regularization quickly shrinks the OLS coefficients by applying a penalty term to the OLS objective function, and minimizing this modified cost function instead of the original OLS objective function
- The penalty term associated with L1 regularization is the absolute value of the magnitude of OLS coefficients, which is the main difference between the L1 and L2 regularization methods
- L1 regularization is used in lasso regression

### Mathematical Properties of L1 Regularization
- L1 regularization involves a diamond-shaped constraint region
- The optimal point intersecting the elliptical contour plot (representing the objective function) and the constraint region lies on an axis where $\beta_{j}=0$, which provides L1 regularization with the function of variable selection
- L1 regularization uses convex optimization, and causes the beta coefficients to converge to 0 quickly

### Use-cases for L1 Regularization
- Coefficient estimation that is robust to outliers
- Variable selection
