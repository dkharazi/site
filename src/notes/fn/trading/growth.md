### Defining Growth Investing
- Roughly, a growth investor looks for stocks they believe are undervalued based on their *potential* worth
- Implying, a growth investor seeks businesses trading at a share price that probably isn't a bargain right now, but is expected to be a bargain in the future
- They believe the company's revenues, cash flows, and profits are expected to grow much faster eventually

### Defining Properties of Growth Stocks
- Sometimes, growth stocks are more expensive
    - Since, sometimes their stock prices are high relative to their sales or profits
    - This is due to expectations from investors of higher sales or profits in the future
    - So, we expect to see high P/E ratios
- Often, growth stocks are riskier
    - In the moment, they're expensive because investors expect high future earnings
    - If growth plans don't materialize, the price could plummet
