### Defining Targeting and LTV Models
- Customer targeting typically involves three models:
    - Propensity model
    - Time-to-event model
    - Lifetime value model
- These models can be used individually or together
- A propensity model estimates the probability of a customer doing some event
- A time-to-event model estimates the number of days until a customer does some event
- A lifetime value model estimates the value of a customer
- The events in a propensity or time-to-event model include:
    - A candidate responding to an email campaign
    - A customer puchasing a specific product
    - A customer expanding to a new prorduct
    - A customer purchasing additional units of a prduct
    - A customer changing shopping habits
    - A customer churning
- All three of these models can help determine the impact of this event
