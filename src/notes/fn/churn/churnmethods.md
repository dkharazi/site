### Introducing Churn Analysis
- There are two primary forms of segmentation:
    - RFM segmentation (i.e. financial)
    - Behavioral segmentation (i.e. customer behavior)
- Typically, we can use both segmentation strategies to help understand customer behavior
    - E.g. why one segment has more churners than another
- For example, customers in one segment
can churn because of low product quality
- Whereas, customers in another segment churn due to high prices
