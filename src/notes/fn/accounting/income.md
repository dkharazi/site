### Introducing Basic Components of an Income Statement
- An income statement includes the following basic components:
    1. Revenue
    2. Expenses
    3. Profits
- Intuitively, these components can be described as:
    - **Revenue:** Income made
    - **Expenses:** Costs
    - **Profit:** Income after costs

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue } - \text{ Expenses}
$$

### Defining Terminology on an Income Statement
- **COGS** is the costs related to inventory
- **Depreciation** is the reduction in value of a tangible asset over time
    - Most tangible assets are fixed assets
    - Some tangible assets are current assets
    - Purchasing land or buildings outright aren't expenses
        - This wouldn't appear on income statements
        - Since there isn't depreciation
- **Operating expense** is the cost from normal business operations
- **Amortization** is the reduction in value of an intangible asset over time
    - Unlike depreciation, amortization applies to intangible assets
    - Some intangible assets are fixed assets
    - Some intangible assets are current assets
- **Gross profit** is the income made after deducting COGS
    - Gross profit is synonymous with *gross income*
- **Net profit** is the income made after deducting COGS and taxes
    - Net profit is synonymous with *net income* and *earnings*
    - Profitability refers to increasing yearly net profit margins

### Illustrating Types of Expenses

### Calculating Profits on an Income Statement

$$
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Revenue } — \text{ COGS}
$$

$$
\text{EBITDA} = \text{Gross Profit } — \text{ Operating Expenses}
$$

$$
\text{EBIT} = \text{EBITDA } — \text{ Depreciation } — \text{ Amortization}
$$

$$
\text{EBT} = \text{EBIT } — \text{ Interest}
$$

$$
\text{Net Profit} = \text{EBT } — \text{ Taxes}
$$
