### Introducing Basic Components of a Balance Sheet
- A balance sheet includes the following basic components:
    1. Assets
        - Current assets
        - Fixed assets
    2. Liabilities
        - Current liabilities
        - Fixed liabilities
    3. Equity
- Intuitively, these components can be described as:
    - **Assets:** What you have
    - **Liabilities:** What you owe
    - **Equity:** What you own

$$
\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \text{Equity}
$$

### Defining Terminology for Assets
- **Current assets** are considered *liquid* or *short-term* assets
    - Specifically, they can be converted to cash within the year
    - They're resources a company uses in its day-to-day operations
    - In other words, they're related to a company's current liabilities
- **Fixed assets** are considered *illiquid* or *long-term* assets
    - Specifically, they can't be easily converted to cash within the year
    - These resources are generally related to PP&E:
        - Product
        - Plant
        - Equipment
    - In other words, they're related to a company's fixed liabilities
- **Capital** is sometimes used to mean cash roughly
    - Sometimes, it can mean machinery and ideas too

- **Fixed liabilities** are considered *long-term* liabilities

    - These can be referred to as *notes payable*
