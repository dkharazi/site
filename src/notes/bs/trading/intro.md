### Introducing Trading with Some Notation
- In trading, the price of a stock represents the value of a company
    - $p_{t}$ is an observed stock price at a given point in time $t$
    - $\dot{p}_{t}$ is the true, unknown stock price at a given point in time $t$
- Thus, $p_{t}$ represents the perceived value of a company
    - Obviously, the perceived value is influenced by:
        - Current earnings
        - Speculation
    - Whereas, the true and inherent value is influenced by:
        - Current earnings

### Describing Influences of Stock Prices
- Roughly, trading assumes the observed stock price $p_{t}$ is nearly equal to its true and inherent valuation $\dot{p}_{t}$
    - Meaning, the amount of speculation is assumed to be negligible
    - Realistically, this assumption rarely holds true
- In other words, the stock price $\dot{p}_{t}$ equals the earnings per share

$$
\text{price} = \text{EPS}
$$

- And, $p_{t}$ should equal $\dot{p}_{t}$
    - Again, this assumption is rarely true
    - Due to a combination of cognitive biases such as the following:
        - Overconfidence
        - Overreaction
        - Representative bias
        - Information bias
        - Other human errors

### Defining the Goal of Trading
- The goal of trading is to buy stocks with a lower price $p_{t}$ than:
    - Its true current price $\dot{p}_{t}$
    - Or its true future price $\dot{p}_{t+i}$
- The first method is known as *value investing*
- The second method is known as *growth investing*
- To effectively achieve growth investing, we must accurately predict the future earnings without any amount of speculation
    - Thus, growth investing involves paying a higher price now if the company will have higher future earnings
    - Usually, current prices are overvalued at a given moment due to expected higher prices in the future
    - A decent range is up to $5-7$ years into the future

### Defining Investing Strategies
- As stated previously, **value investing** involves buying stocks with a lower current price than its current intrinsic value
- Whereas, **growth investing** involves buying stocks with a lower current price than its future intrinsic value
- Another investing strategy is **momentum investing**
- Momentum involves buying stocks with high returns over the past $3-12$ months, and selling stocks with poor returns over the same period
    - Generally, momentum is used in high-frequency trading
    - Many of these trades operate over small time scales
    - Often, executing dozens or hundreds of trades per second

### Describing Stock Valuation Methods
- The most popular method for stock valuation is *discounted cash flow*
- DCF is a method using concepts of the time value of money
- DCF is widely used in the following other sectors:
    - Investment finance
    - Real estate development
    - Corporate financial management
    - Patent valuation
