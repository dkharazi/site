### Introducing Basic Components of a Balance Sheet
- A balance sheet includes the following basic components:
    1. Assets
        - Current assets
        - Fixed assets
    2. Liabilities
        - Current liabilities
        - Fixed liabilities
    3. Equity
- Intuitively, these components can be described as:
    - **Assets:** What you have
    - **Liabilities:** What you owe
    - **Equity:** What you own

$$
\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \text{Equity}
$$

### Defining Terminology for Assets
- **Current assets** are considered *liquid* or *short-term* assets
    - Specifically, they can be converted to cash within the year
    - They're resources a company uses in its day-to-day operations
    - In other words, they're related to a company's current liabilities
- **Fixed assets** are considered *illiquid* or *long-term* assets
    - Specifically, they can't be easily converted to cash within the year
    - These resources are generally related to PP&E:
        - Product
        - Plant
        - Equipment
    - In other words, they're related to a company's fixed liabilities
- **Operating assets** are assets producing revenue in the daily operations of a business
    - Operating assets can include both current and fixed assets
    - Operating assets can include allocated cash, allocated inventory, buildings in use, machinery in use, etc.
    - Non-operating assets can include unallocated cash, unallocated inventory, vacant buildings, vacant land, unused machinery, etc.
- **Capital** is sometimes used to mean cash roughly
    - Sometimes, it can refer to machinery and ideas too
- **Working capital** is a measure of a company’s liquidity and short-term financial health
    - Working capital is the difference between a company’s current assets and current liabilities
    - High working capital isn’t always a good thing, since it could indicate that the business has too much inventory or is not investing its excess cash

### Defining Terminology for Liabilities
- **Current liabilities** are considered *short-term* liabilities
    - Specifically, these are debts due in less than $1$ year
    - They are obligations that will be settled by current assets
    - These can be referred to as *accounts payable*
- **Fixed liabilities** are considered *long-term* liabilities
    - Specifically, these are debts due over many years
    - They are obligations that will be settled by fixed assets
    - These can be referred to as *notes payable*

### Defining Terminology for Equity
- **Common stock** refers to the number of a company's shares of stock
    - Sometimes, equity more generally just refers to common stock
- **Market capitalization** refers to the dollar value of a company's shares of stock
