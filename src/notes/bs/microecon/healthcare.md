### Notes
Complaints about third party intervention:
1. Third Parties
    - Insurers, governments, and unwitting bystanders are typically involved
    - Meaning, they have an interest in healthcare outcomes
    - Generally, market failures can be created when third parties enter a buyer/seller market
2. Seller receives payment from third party, instead of buyer
    - Healthcare providers are often paid not by the patients but by private or government health insurance
    - Generally, including a third party in the relationship of the buyer and select can create market failures
3. Allocation of resources are determined by rules established by third party
    - Rules established by insurers determine the allocation of resources
    - Allocation of resources should be determined by market prices in a perfectly competitive market

Complaints about lack of third party (less government intervention):
1. Prevalence of Externalities
    - Externalities in the healthcare market are extremely prevalent 
    - Because externalities are so prevalent, they may need government action to remedy market failure
    - A few examples of externalities:
        - Getting vaccinated is a positive externality
            - Getting vaccinated has some cost: money or receiving side effects
            - Thus, too few people would decide to get vaccinated on their own
            - As a result, there wouldn’t be a huge need to develop vaccines, since it wouldn’t so profitable
            - Unless, the government requires vaccination
            - This subsidizes development, manufacture, and distribution of vaccines
        - The benefit of medical research is a positive externality to other physicians
            - Without government intervention, there would be too little research
            - Governments can incentivize research through funding and by granting patents
2. Everyone involved doesn’t have perfect information
    - Buyers rely on the advice of sellers for what the buyer needs (e.g. types of treatment)
    - Generally, knowledge needs to shared evenly between buyers and sellers to avoid market failures
    - This causes the need for:
        - Monitoring of the quality of a product
        - Buying leads to various regulations
        - Licensing requirements
        - Too difficult to open new medical schools
        - FDA regulations
    - The above regulations limit the supply of healthcare goods and services
3. Arguably: Healthcare is a public good
    - Market failure occurs with public goods

Complaints with the Insurance Market:
1. Problem of Moral Hazard
    - Moral hazard refers to the tendency of a person to engage in undesirable behavior because he/she is imperfectly monitored
    - If patients don’t pay for doctor visits, then they may go often for minor symptoms (e.g. cold, flu, etc.)
    - This leads to increased unnecessary costs and longer wait times
    - To avoid this, insurance companies charge patients co-pays (e.g. $20)
2. Adverse Selection
    - Some customers have preexisting conditions or chronic diseases, which aren’t observable by insurers
    - As a result, people with greater hidden health problems are more likely to buy health insurance than healthy people
    - In order for insurance companies to cover its costs, the price of health insurance must reflect the cost of a sicker-than-average person (since healthier people opted out)
    - As people drop coverage, the insurance market fails to achieve its purpose of eliminating the financial risk from illness
    - This is a phenomenon called the death spiral

The Affordable Care Act and Adverse Selection:
- The Affordable Care Act attempted to reduce the problem of adverse selection
- It required Americans to either buy health insurance or pay a tax (acting as a penalty)
- Specifically, it prevented insurers from charging more to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions
- The goal of the mandate was to increase the number of healthy people buying insurance
- Thereby, reducing the problem of adverse selection and lowering the cost of insurance
