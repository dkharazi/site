2. Trade-offs
3. Self-interest
4. Rationality
5. Economic models match reality

### Defining Types of Market Structures
1. Monopoly
2. Oligoply
3. Monopolistic competition
4. Perfect competition

### Relevant Notes
- Perfectly competetive models of markets make assumptions
    - Many real-life markets aren't perfectly competitive
- Markets are usually a good way to organize economy activity.  
- In absence of market failures, the outcome of a perfectly competitive market is efficient, maximizing total surplus
- However, self-interested buyers and sellers neglect the external benefits/costs of their actions, so the market outcome is not efficient.  
- Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
- In presence of externalities, public policy can improve efficiency
- If market failure exists, then the key question is whether the costs of intervening in the markets to address the failure outweigh the benefits
- Milton Friedman acknowledged that market failures exist
- However, he believed there were only a few scenarios where the cost of intervening outweighed the benefit of addressing the market failure
- Markets are effective at allocating scarce resources, assuming these markets are perfectly competitive
- Perfect competition ensures:
    - Everyone has perfect information
        - i.e. knowledge is shared evenly between buyers and sellers
        - e.g. intermediary third-party insurance companies between buyers and sellers in healthcare market
    - No barriers to entry
        - i.e. no individual firms can influence price
        - e.g. monopolies
    - Transaction costs are low
    - There aren’t externalities
    - There aren’t public goods being sold
- Very few markets or industries in the real world are perfectly competitive
- However, it is still useful in some respects.
- Many primary and commodity markets, such as coffee and tea, exhibit many of the characteristics of perfect competition
