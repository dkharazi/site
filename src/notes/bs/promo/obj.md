### Describing the Environment for Promotions
- As an overview, the environment for promotions can contain:
    - **Consumers:** People consuming a good (e.g. end customer)
    - **Retailers:** People selling to consumers (e.g. Kroger)
    - **Wholesalers:** People selling to retailers (e.g. General Mills)
    - **Manufacturers:** People selling to wholesalers or retailers (e.g. General Mills or farmers)
- A retailer owns marketing channels
    - Promotions are communicated to consumers via marketing channels
    - Promotions can also be communicated via marketing channels of wholesalers and manufacturers too

### Defining the Benefits of Promotions
- Promotions stimulate return shopping trips
- Promotions increase basket size
- Promotions improve loyalty to the retailer

### Introducing Customer Targeting
- The goal of promotions is to provide incentives to consumers
- By doing this, promotions will improve sales and build better relationships
- As a reminder, promotions have the following major problems:
    - Customer targeting
    - Product discovery
- For now, we'll just focus on customer targeting
- Customer targeting must answer these problems:
    - Who are the right recipients for a promotion?
    - What are the right promotional properties?
    - What is the optimal time to offer it?
    - What is the right delivery channel?
- The best method for customer targeting is *targeted campaigns*

### Motivating the Use of Targeted Campaigns
- The best method for customer targeting is *targeted campaigns*
- A targeted campaign involves the following steps:
    - Plan something
    - Execute that something
    - Measure that something

### Defining Business Objectives for Promotions
- Business objectives of promotions should focus on maximizing ROI
- Each campaign should have a positive ROI
    - ROI is defined as the difference between *gains* and *costs*
- The ROI should be:
    - Predicted before campaign execution
    - Measured after the campaign is fully or partially executed

### Defining the Gains and Costs of Promotions
- The costs of a campaign include:
    - Distribution costs
        - Coupon design and printing costs
        - Marketing agency fees
    - Coupon-redemption costs
    - Clearing-house costs
- The gains of a campaign include sales

### How to Maximize the ROI of Campaigns
- Targeted campaigns have the following purposes:
    - Testing something
    - Measuring something
- As a result, targeted campaigns act as:
    - A lesson teaching us if something is effective
    - A tool for acquiring, maximizing, and retaining customers
- In order to maximize ROI of campaigns, we must focus on each of the three phases of the customer lifecycle
- Meaning, each campaign should analyze each phase of the customer lifecycle:
    - Customer acquisition
    - Customer maximization
    - Customer retention

### Defining the Goals of Customer Lifecycle
- Customer acquisition focuses on the customers never interacted with the brand
- Customer maximization focuses on the customers who interact with the brand
- Customer churn focuses on the customers who stop interacting with the brand
- The goal of customer acquisition is to *increase new customers*
- The goal of customer maximization is to *increase the number of products purchased by existing customers*
- The goal of customer retention is to *increase the number of potentially lost customers*
- Increasing each of these three phases will maximize the ROI of a campaign

### Illustrating the Customer Lifecycle Model
- The goal of a customer lifecycle model is to model the sales customer's gain at each phase of the customer lifecycle
- To do to this, the lifecycle model contains two components:
    - Predicting customer propensity
    - Predicting customer sales gain
- Here, customer propensity refers to the customer's chance of gaining
- Here, customer sales gain refers to the sales generated by the customer
- In other words, we must:
    - First, predict a customer's sales gain
    - Then, predict the customer's propensity
- We should target high-propensity customers with large sales gains
- Meaning, we'd like to find the customers we're certain will generate the highest expected sales

### Defining a Framework for Customer Lifecycle
- A campaign model must predict the customer's sales gain by comparing:
    - The expected sales gain without a campaign
    - The expected sales gain with a campaign
- These must predict customer propensity and customer sales gain
