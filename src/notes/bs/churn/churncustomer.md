### Aggregating at Different Time Periods
- Typically, it is useful to measure features for different time periods
- By doing this, we can integrate a measure of recency when clustering on features
- For example, we can create features for the following:
    - Number of clicks in L12M
    - Number of clicks in L6M
    - Average number of clicks per week

### Measuring Aggregates of Event Properties
- There are many different aggregates that can be used for clustering
- The following are a few example:
    - Counts
    - Means
    - Sums
