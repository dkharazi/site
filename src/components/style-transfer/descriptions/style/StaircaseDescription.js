                <b><i>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2</i></b> is a 1912
                painting by Marcel Duchamp. The work is widely regarded as a
                Modernist classic and has become one of the most famous of its
                time. Before its first presentation at the 1912 Salon des
                Indépendants in Paris it was rejected by the Cubists as being
                too Futurist. It was then exhibited with the Cubists at Galeries
                Dalmau's Exposició d'Art Cubista, in Barcelona, 20 April–10 May 1912.
                The painting was subsequently shown, and ridiculed, at the 1913 Armory Show in
                New York City.

                Henri-Robert-Marcel Duchamp was a French-American painter, sculptor, chess player,
                and writer whose work is associated with Cubism, Dada, and conceptual art.
                Duchamp is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as
                one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in
                the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century, responsible for
                significant developments in painting and sculpture.
