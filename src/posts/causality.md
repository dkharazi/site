## Regression Assumptions

## Difference-In-Differences Assumptions

## Synthetic Control Assumptions
This counterfactual, called the “synthetic unit,” serves to outline what would have happened to the aggregate treated unit had the treatment never occurred. It is a powerful, yet surprisingly simple, generalization of the difference-in-differences strategy.

## Synthetic Control Advantages
1. The method precludes extrapolation
2. Helps the researcher avoid *peeking* at the results while specifying the model
3. The weights that are chosen make explicit what each unit is contributing to the counterfactual
4. Bridges a gap between qualitative and quantitative types
